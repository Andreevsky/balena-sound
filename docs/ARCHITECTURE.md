# Architecture

## Explanation
balenaSound bases on balenaCloud and its features. balenaCloud gives the OS/Code updates and a API for interacting out of the container.

## Containers
Every service runs in a seperate docker container. Since it runs on docker every os can be used. This allows us to use lots of projects made for Linux.
