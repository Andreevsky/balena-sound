# Hardware required

* Raspberry Pi 3A+/3B/3B+/4B/Zero W
* SD Card (we recommend 8GB Sandisk Extreme Pro)
* Power supply
* 3.5mm audio cable to the input on your speakers/Hi-Fi (usually 3.5mm or RCA). Alternatively you can use the HDMI port to get digital audio out.

**Notes** 
- The Raspberry Pi Zero cannot be used on it's own as it has no audio output. To use the Pi Zero you'll need to add something like the [Pimoroni pHAT DAC](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/phat-dac) (out of stock and going to be replaced, see [#111](https://github.com/balenalabs/balena-sound/issues/111)) to go with it.
