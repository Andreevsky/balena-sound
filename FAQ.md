Does it support the Raspberry Pi 4?

Why is Landr using Netlify instead of GitHub Pages?
---------------------------------------------------

Netlify can do everything that GitHub Pages can do, and it also provides some
extra features and flexibility that we find really valuable for Landr, such as
being able to deploy more than one branch of a site at the same time, A/B
testing, form submissions management, and more. On top all of that, Netlify is free to use!
