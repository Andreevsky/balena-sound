Does balenaSound support WIFI?
-------------------------------------------

Yes. We balenaOS supports most Wifi modules(integrated and external). Including all of the Raspberry Pi series. Before downloading the image you are able to enter the SSID and the password of your WLAN. The Pi will then automaticly connect to the specified WIFI on boot.

Can I extend my Landr website with a page I fully control?
----------------------------------------------------------

Sure! Landr generates static HTML, CSS, and JS. You can add more files to the
bundle as you wish before pushing them to Netlify.

Why is Landr using Netlify instead of GitHub Pages?
---------------------------------------------------

Netlify can do everything that GitHub Pages can do, and it also provides some
extra features and flexibility that we find really valuable for Landr, such as
being able to deploy more than one branch of a site at the same time, A/B
testing, form submissions management, and more. On top all of that, Netlify is free to use!
